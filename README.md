# Tying Your Shoes: Beginner

### So you want to tie your shoes. Here's how.

1. locate the two sides of the shoe and the laces coming out of each
2. Grasp one lace in each hand comfortably
3. Make an **X** with the two laces
4. Tuck one lace under the other and switch which lace is in which hand
5. Make a loop with one side of the shoelace
6. Wrap the unlooped lace loosely around the looped lace 
7. Say step 6 out loud several times and continue to step 8
8. Take a portion of the wrapping lace through the hole between the x and the loops you created when you looped it
9. Pull on each loop until tight
  - optional: repeat steps 6,8 with loops to double-knot

### Your progression should look like this

`find laces`->`cross laces`->`loop laces`->`tighten`

#### Troubleshooting

1. `Error: loops disappear after tightening`
  - reexamine the ratio of loop:lace length. you should have an equal amount of each.
2. `Error: fingers stuck in loop 1`
  - make sure you are leaving yourself slack in each of your loops and wraps.
